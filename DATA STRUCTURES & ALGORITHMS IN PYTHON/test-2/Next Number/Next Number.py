Given a large number represented in the form of a linked list. Write code to increment the number by 1 in-place(i.e. without using extra space).
Note: You don't need to print the elements, just update the elements and return the head of updated LL.
Input Constraints:
1 <= Length of Linked List <=10^6.
Input format :
Line 1 : Linked list elements (separated by space and terminated by -1)
Output Format :
Line 1: Updated linked list elements 
Sample Input 1 :
3 9 2 5 -1
Sample Output 1 :
3 9 2 6
Sample Input 2 :
9 9 9 -1
Sample Output 1 :
1 0 0 0
